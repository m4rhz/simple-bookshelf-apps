## Simple Bookshelf App

This simple web app allows you to add books to your bookshelf and mark them as read or unread. It uses DOM and JavaScript web storage to save the books you add.

To get started, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You should see a simple form where you can add the title and author of a book. Click the "Add Book" button to add the book to your bookshelf.

To mark a book as read, click the "Read" checkbox next to the book title. To mark a book as unread, click the "Unread" checkbox.

The app will save the books you add to your bookshelf using JavaScript web storage. This means that your bookshelf will be preserved even if you close the browser window.
